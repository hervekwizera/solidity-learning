# Learn Solidity with Cyfrin

Welcome to my Solidity learning journey! This repository follows the [Cyfrin Solidity Course](https://www.learnweb3.io/cyfrin-foundry-full-course/) and documents my progress, notes, code examples, and project challenges. If you're learning smart contract development using Solidity and Foundry, you're in the right place!
